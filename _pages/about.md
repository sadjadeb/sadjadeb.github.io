I'm Sajad Ebrahimi, an M.A.Sc student in Computer Engineering at University of Guelph. My research has been focused on Information Retrieval where I have worked on the Generative Ranking, Query Performance Prediction (QPP), and Reviewer Assignment Problem (RAP). I am working at the [LS3](https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/bagheri-ebrahim/) and [Dr. Fattane Zarrinkalam](https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/people/fattane-zarrinkalam). Prior to that, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Behshid Behkamal](http://prof.um.ac.ir/behkamal/) at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

You can find my CV [here](/files/SajadEbrahimi_CV.pdf).
