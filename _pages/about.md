<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a graduate researcher in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, currently pursuing my M.A.Sc. in Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph. I am working at the [LS3](https://ls3.rnet.torontomu.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/bagheri-ebrahim/) and [Dr. Fattane Zarrinkalam](https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/people/fattane-zarrinkalam). Prior to that, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Behshid Behkamal](http://prof.um.ac.ir/behkamal/) at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

My research spans two main directions:
1. **Diffusion-based generative ranking**: applying denoising diffusion models to improve ranking effectiveness in information retrieval systems.
2. **Enhancing the peer-review process**: developing models and tools to assess and improve review quality, aiming to make scholarly evaluation more reliable and fair.

I have published multiple papers in venues such as SIGIR, ECIR, and CIKM, and combine my research with industry experience as a Data Scientist, where I design and deploy large-scale ranking systems, vector search infrastructures, and NLP pipelines. Currently, I work at [Reviewerly](https://reviewer.ly/), developing and maintaining large-scale scholarly search and matching systems used in peer-review and grant assignment.

You can find my CV [here](/SajadEbrahimi_CV.pdf).
